The demand for COVID-19 tests is soaring along with the infection rate as the omicron variant swamps Florida.

Tampa Bay's local governments reduced the number of free, public testing sites in favor of private providers before the holidays. Now they're opening new sites to reduce the lines at existing public sites.

Public vs. private test sites

Testing at a public site is free, whether or not you have insurance. The site may bill your insurer, however. Most do not require appointments, though walk-ups may have to wait in line. Check in advance.

Private providers such as clinics, pharmacies and urgent care centers may require appointments and may treat the test as a medical appointment, adding paperwork and time to your test. They could also charge you or your insurer, so call in advance to find out the insurance and cost requirements.

Wherever you get tested, bring your ID and provide your full name, address and contact information so you can receive the test results. And wear your mask.

Note:Public sites could close early if they run out of tests. Check your county government's social media accounts to see if they're still open before heading there.

Omicron is harder to test for

Not only is omicron the most contagious variant yet, but it may also be harder to detect. Rapid antigen tests appear to be less sensitive to the variant and may not detect early infections, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

Rapid antigen tests are popular because they can produce results in minutes, which is why they're available for use at home. A testing site should report antigen results within hours.

Molecular PCR tests are more accurate, but the results could take days to come in.

You may want to take multiple antigen tests to be sure you're negative. If your antigen test is negative but you have symptoms, you should take a PCR test.
