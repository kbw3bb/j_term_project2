The city of Tampa joined Hillsborough County on Wednesday in requiring its employees to wear masks inside city facilities and in city-owned vehicles when traveling with other people, citing the surge in cases from the omicron variant of COVID-19.

In a directive issued to employees Wednesday afternoon, city human resources director Kelly Austin said members of the public ages two and older also will be required to wear a mask when visiting city buildings. However they will not be refused entry or service. The city will work to create other means to provide the service needed, which the memo says is in keeping with a state prohibition against mask mandates.

The directive indicated that all city employees are being encouraged to receive vaccinations and boosters as the most effective way of avoiding adverse health effect from the virus.
